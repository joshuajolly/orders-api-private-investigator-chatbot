# Private-Investigator-Chatbot
Step into the shoes of a Private Investigator called to the scene of a murder. A fun whodunit using IBM's Conversion and Tone Analyzing APIs.

Developed for the chatbot MindSumo competition, https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/chatbot. 

#How to use
Download the JSON file at \data\Private-Investigator-Chatbot.json to your computer.
Nagivate to https://watson-conversation.ng.bluemix.net/instances.
At the top it will say {Workspaces} {Create} {^}.
Click the upload icon (or {^})
When it says "Import a workspace", navigate to your downloaded JSON file.
You now have two options:
1. At the top right corner you can click the icon that looks like a speech bubble with a (...) inside.
This will allow you to immediately use the Conversation without downloading.
If you would like to deploy it to Slack or a similar service, on the far left corner click the circular pointer (its the third icon down), and it will walk you through deploying the app.
2. If you would like to run the app locally, download this repository at https://github.com/joshuajolly/Private-Investigator-Chatbot/archive/master.zip
Make sure you have Python 3.X.X installed.
